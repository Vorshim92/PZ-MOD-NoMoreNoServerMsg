title=Server Alert Fix [ONLY B41 - Fixed in B42]
description=This mod fixes a critical bug where players would miss server alert messages when the in-game chat was closed. With this fix, essential notifications like restart warnings, emergency announcements, or anything from the "servermsg" command will always appear on-screen, ensuring no player misses vital information. A must-have for smooth multiplayer server management in Project Zomboid!

description=Please note: This mod is not necessary for Build 42, as the developers have implemented a new event (Events.OnAlertMessage.Add(ISAlert.getAlert)) to handle server alerts independently of the chat. However, it's an excellent solution for those who wish to maintain a server on Build 41, as it replicates nearly the same functionality introduced in Build 42.
