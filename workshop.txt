description=This mod fixes a critical bug where players would miss server alert messages when the in-game chat was closed. With this fix, essential notifications like restart warnings or emergency announcements or anythings from "servermsg" command, will always appear on-screen, ensuring no player misses vital information. A must-have for smooth multiplayer server management in Project Zomboid!
